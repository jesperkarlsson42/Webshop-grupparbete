# Build a Webshop

_A webshop made with jQuery and jQuery UI as a school assignment, no focus on the payment functionalities_

Examples of functionality of the webshop:

- Add products to a shopping cart
- Simulate a purchase on the checkoutpage
- Calculate a totalprice on the products in the shopping cart
- Store the information in the shopping cart through extended objects, not only one product
- Decrease/increase the amount of products in the shoppingcart and checkoutpage
